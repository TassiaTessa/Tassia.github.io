summary: "This is my HTML website which displays both my basic coding knowledge and gives you a preview into my Art"
---

This website goes through each art media I enjoy using and my current experience using them. It highlights my usage of: Paint, Markers, Digital Media, and miscellaneous projects.

This was my first time ever coding, and while HTML is relatively easy compared to other coding languages I still think there are a few issues with the overall organization of the code. Nevertheless, the website runs so that counts for something. The code utilizes different functions to create rollover images.
