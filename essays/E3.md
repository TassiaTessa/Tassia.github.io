Doing WOD/Poke 5.1 

Found at [Dr Ports site here](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/050.variables_data_types/experience-SmartPhoneProducts1_variables.html).



This Poke Should have been easier than my previous Pokeâ€™s. I mapped it all out as you can see here: 
![My prep](https://tassiatessa.github.io/img/WOD5.png)

I always love to do prep in notion since it makes it organized and easy to copy code, organizing things give me a dopamine hit so making my plan look nice makes it seem easier to do. 

The issues: My issues were not the WOD but recording. My computer kept on freezing. After 3 attempts I had to give up and restart my laptop. You think for how expensive this laptop is it could record and run VS code at the same time.

As you can see, earlier, what I did to prepare was adding a checklist which outlined the document instructions and made it easier to copy and paste things. 
For next WOD I need to learn Regex, remembering simple commands would have made this process much faster.
